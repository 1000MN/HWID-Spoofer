- What is a HWID Spoofer -

The HWID spoofer, which is also known as HWID changer, is simply a tool that enables you to manipulate or alter hardware IDs, making them varied to beat the anti-cheat system. HWID spoofer can easily be regarded as an anti-cheat bypass. That said, it is good to note that all anti-cheat systems do not function in the same way â€“ some tend to be more intense than others. HWID banning techniques are different on each games. For example, COD Warzone is especially using Shadow-ban feature. If you have Shadow-banned, your game client will not allow to connect normal game. So it is crucial to use appropriate HWID Spoofer with decent Warzone Hacks which is not detected. This is why it is expedient to have a good HWID changer installed if you wish to keep enjoying gameplay with hacks activated.
